# How does it fit into DevOps?

3 million hours 
Security - information security team Biometric 
Air conditioning - heat for optimisation
Multiple ways of destroying

Pay as you go 
Built on premises 
Helps us release software faster
Able to adapt quickly
Not beneficial for small scale/offices/labs

The Monolith
- Simple but has limitations and complexity 
- Heavy apps can slow down the start up time
- Each update results into redeploying the full stack app
- Challenging to scale up on demand
- Fruitful for simple and lightweight apps

### What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

Availability zones are important in case one data centre goes down to avoid having a single point of failure. 
Where there is a issue with zone, you would be diverted 

- Most functionality 
- Largest community of customers and partners 
- Most secure
- Fastest pace of innovation 
- Most proven operational expertise

AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers as many Regions with multiple Availability Zones connected by low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking. AWS has 84 Availability Zones within 26 geographic regions around the world, and has announced plans for 24 more Availability Zones and 8 more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The AWS Region and Availability Zone model has been recognized by Gartner as the recommended approach for running enterprise applications that require high availability.

### AWS best practices - naming convention

- Maximum number of tags per resource – 10
- Maximum key length – 127 Unicode characters 
- Maximum value length – 255 Unicode characters
- Tag keys and values are case sensitive 
- Tag keys must be unique per resource  
- Do not use the “aws:” prefix in your tag name or values because it is reserved for AWS use

### What is laaS 
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS is one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless.

### What is Platform as a service (PaaS)
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.

### What is SaaS

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organisation, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service provider’s data centre. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your organisation to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.
